    <h1>Definitive Sonic Games Guide</h1>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <p>I made this guide as an easy and convenient reference on my quest to play all the Sonic games (or at least most of them).<br />
        Below, you'll find a list of a bunch of sonic games and what I believe to be the definitive version to play them.<br />
        This list wont be perfect. I might miss stuff, or new mods or game versions may be released.<br />
        If you find an error, or a section that fails to mention an alternative way to play the game, please message me on <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/voxel123.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> so I can edit this page.</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2>The legality of emulation</h2>
      <p>This is a really difficult topic to discuss, since there are no consistent court rulings to go off of.<br />
        If you want a heavily summarized and cut down explanation:<br />
        -Downloading an Emulator is always fine. They don’t contain copyrighted material.<br />
        -Extracting the ROM of a game you physically own and emulating that shouldn’t get you into trouble. You own that game.<br />
        -Downloading ROM’s from the internet is a different story. I don’t recommend you do this, especially for games that are still actively sold.<br />
        Usually, only the people distributing the ROM’s get into trouble, but if you expect SEGA employees to knock at your door tomorrow<br />
        to search your PC for ROM’s, you should probably stay away from online downloads.</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2>What is RetroArch?</h2>
      <p>Whenever i'm going to mention emulation in this guide, i'll also provide a link to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">RetroArch</a> next to the regular emulator.<br />
        RetroArch has two big advantages over standalone emulation:<br />
        1. Its incredibly easy to keep all your emulators and ROMs in one place<br />
        2. You can conenct RetroArch to <a target="_blank" href="https://retroachievements.org/">RetroAchievements</a>, allowing you to track community-made achievemnts for every<br />
        game you play, even if it orginally didnt have any</p>

    <h1>3D Games</h2>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SA1">Sonic Adventure</h2>
      <p>Vanilla Sonic Adventures definitive release is its Dreamcast release. Every version after this one has only downgraded the game<br />
        (In both objective and subjective ways). Instead of emulating the game, we'll use its PC release as a basis,<br />
        bring it as close to the Dreamcast version as possible, and add a few small quality of life mods.<br />
        We'll use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-mod-installer/-/wikis/home">SADX Mod Installer</a> for this, since it comes prepackaged with everything well need,<br />
        and also turns the 2011 Steam release into the 2004 PC version. Most mods are made for the 2004 version.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>-Sonic Adventure DX (Steam / 2004 PC) + SADX Mod Installer | 8€</p>
    <h3>Alternatives:</h3>
      <p>-Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast)</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>(If you use the non-Steam version as a basis, the installer might not work. I havent tested it yet. IF this should be the case,<br />
        just download the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager/releases">Mod Manager</a> directly and <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/games/5892">search</a> for the mods you want to add.)</p>
      <p>The Installer comes prepackaged with the Mod Manager, and all of the mods we'll need. Select Custom Mode,<br />
        make sure all the useful options like auto updates are turned on, and select the mods you want.<br />
        Since we want to active most of them, i've just listed the ones you might NOT want to use:<br />
        - Dreamcast Character Pack (Only contains the Dreamcast models. The Textures are part of another mod.<br />
        Avoid this if you like the lankier DX models better, add it if you prefer the Dreamcast models)<br />
        - Pause Hide (You don't need this. Its Part of another mod)<br />
        - Steam Achievements (Remove if you don't own the Steam version, otherwise leave it in)<br />
        - ADX Voices and Music (Remove if you own the Steam version. It already comes with the better audio)<br />
        - Super Sonic (in action Stages) (Remove if you don't want super sonic as a post story unlock)<br />
        Again, you can just activate everything else.<br />
        Tip: “SADX Style Water” mods in the original water. Its just named weirdly.</p>
      <p>Now start the Mod Manager (Not the Game) and Launch the game via the manager. Have fun playing ;3</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SA2">Sonic Adventure 2</h2>
      <p>Vanilla Sonic Adventure 2 doesn't have a super clear definitive release.<br />
        Overall, the original Dreamcast version is still superior with better lighting, less visual bugs and better controls,<br />
        but it doesn't have the ported “Battle” versions high resolution graphics, and multiplayer mode.<br />
        Well use Battles Steam release as a basis, bring it as close to the Dreamcast version as possible, and add a few quality of life mods.<br />
        Well also use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/15436">SA Mod Manager</a> (the same one we used for SA1), which is a continuation of the older <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/6333">SA 2 Mod Loader</a>.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Versions:</h3>
      <p>1. Sonic Adventure 2 Battle (Steam) + SA Mod Manager | 10€<br />
        2. Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast)</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>First, get the SA Mod Manager EXE. Either download it from the link above, or copy it from your SA1 folder.<br />
        Copy this file into your Sonic Adventure 2 folder. (You can find it by right clicking the game in steam and<br />
        clicking “Browse Local Files”.) If the Mod Manager crashes when you start it (or switch from SA1 to SA2),<br />
        create a new folder called “mods” in the SA2 folder.</p>
      <p>First, you can activate two quality of life changes in the “Codes” tab. These two will alter the feel of the game,<br />
        so consider if you actually want them.<br />
        (This is also where all cheat codes are stored. If you wanna be invincible, explore this window some more):<br />
        -Reduce spindash delay (Hold down the button for a shorter time until you can spindash)<br />
        -All emeralds trackable (Tracks all three Emerald Pieces at the same time)</p>
      <p>Now onto the mods. This is also their recommended load order (I think?):<br />
        -<a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/48874">No model Tinting</a> (Restores the original textures of some bad looking models.<br />
        While its now part of SA2 render fix, this standalone mod is a lot simpler, so you don't need to adjust any other stuff)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/48872">Cutscene Revamp</a> (Fixes lighting and missing background models in cutscenes)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/48912">Highest Quality Textures</a> (Always uses the highest quality texture if the devs kept multiple versions in the files)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/48950">Hedge Panel</a> (A bunch of quality of life changes to Sonic and Shadows gameplay.<br />
        Also comes with modern (boost game) style grinding. This doesn't fix rail grinding, but its a good enough bandaid patch.<br />
        If you're more of a purist, you might want to turn off Random homing attack sounds.<br />
        But you should definitely turn off Automatic Magic Hands and No Magic Orbs, as they make sonic a bit op)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/48894">Level oddity patch</a> (Fixes a bunch of small issues)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/491615">Level oddity patch 2</a> (Fixes some different small issues)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/397234">Eggman lighting fix</a> (The headlights of Eggman's mech light up dark areas again. While its now part of SA2 render fix,<br />
        this standalone mod is a lot simpler, so you don't need to adjust any other stuff)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/381193">SA2 Volume Controls</a> (Restores sound features, and lets you adjust the audio mixing.<br />
        Id recommend lowering the music volume just a little bit more than the default)</p>
      <p>If the load order is correct, you shouldn't encounter any new bugs ingame. Have fun playing ;3</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="ShtH">Shadow the Hedgehog</h2>
      <p>We`ll be using Shadow Reloaded, which is a mod for the Gamecube version of the game. For this, you'll need a ROM of Shadow the Hedgehog,<br/>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/407141">the mod</a>, and an Emulator. I'd recommend Dolphin, either <a target="_blank" href="https://de.dolphin-emu.org/">standalone</a>, or the Dolphin core via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">RetroArch</a>.</p>
      <p>(Shadow Reloaded makes the last story available after only 3 playthroughs, unlocks expert mode after finishing the last story,<br />
        alternate paths have been added, and "kill x enemies" missions no longer require you to search for every single enemy in a level.)</p>
      <p>(RetroArch can be a bit complicated to set up, but it can be nice to have all your emulators and ROMs accessible in one place.<br />
        It also allows you to connect a <a target="_blank" href="https://retroachievements.org/">RetroAchievements</a> account in the settings.)<br />
        (RetroAchievements is a site that tracks user-curated achievements for old emulated games.)</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Shadow the Hedgehog (Gamecube) + Shadow Reloaded</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>Once you have the ROM and downloaded the mod, open the mod's folder, drag your ROM (.iso) inside, and rename the ROM to GUPE8P.<br/>
        Run the “Apply Patch” that matches your operating system, and once the console is done printing stuff,<br />
        you should have a file named ShdTH Reloaded.</p>
      <p>Now you can just run this file on your Emulator. Have fun playing ;3</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="S06">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</h2>
      <p> Sonic '06 is a pretty buggy game, and on top of that the different playable charcters dont really feel unique.<br />
        Luckily, a from-the-ground-up and standalone fan remake, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChaosX/videos">Project '06</a>, has been in development for years, and is almost done,<br />
        only missing the final story.<br />
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Project '06</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>Just head to ChaosX' youtube channel via the link, and look for the newest video titled '06 Release.<br />
        The download link will be in the description.</p>
      <p>That's all. Have fun playing ;3</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SSR">Sonic and the Secret Rings</h2>
      <p>Secret Rings was ever only released for the wii, and its modding scene is extremely small. There is a from-the-ground-up fan remake<br />
        called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kuma-Boo/project-reignition/releases">Project Reignition</a>, and while its playable, its not fully done.<br />
        For the time being, id reccomend sticking with a rom of the original rlease via Dolphin, either <a target="_blank" href="https://de.dolphin-emu.org/">standalone</a> or via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">RetroArch</a>,<br />
        but once the remake is a bit further along it will be the definitive way to play this game.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic and the Secret Rings (Wii)</p>
    <h3>Alternatives:</h3>
      <p>Project Reignition</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>(A guide will be added once the remake is a bit further along in its development)</p>
      <p>Have fun playing ;3</p>
      
    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="BN">Sonic and the Back Knight</h2>
      <p>Sonic and the Black Knight only every got a Wii release, and there arent any mods or fan remakes.</p>
    <h3>Definitve Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic and the Black Knight (Wii)</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>Just get the ROM, and play it directly via <a target="_blank" href="https://de.dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">RetroArch</a>.</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SU">Sonic Unleashed</h2>
      <p>Sonic unleashed recently got <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp/releases">recompiled</a> for pc. This version of the game is based on the xBox release,<br />
        and also needs the xBox rom to function. That means it includes the world map, but also the longer werehog stages and medals.<br />
        We will use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager/releases">HedgeModManager</a> to adress these issues, but if you enjoy the werehog in this version,<br />
        you can also just emulate the PS3 or xBox release.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic Unleashed Recompiled + HedgeModManager</p>
    <h3>Alternatives:</h3>
      <p>Sonic Unleashed (PS3/xBox)</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>While installing Recompiled, it will already ask you for the rom.<br />
        Afterwards, install the Mod Manager and add the following mods:<br />
        (Sadly, there is not mod shortening the werehog stages yet. If you want to stay up to date with possible releases,<br />
        <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/requests/72758">this bounty</a> will probably be the place where youll hear about the mod first.)<br />
        Other than that, we'll download:<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/578912">Improved Progression</a> (You don't have to visit professor pickle for every level anymore,<br />
        and the werehog gains abilities in batches, so youll be max level by the end of the game)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/579600">No Medal Requirements for Main Acts</a> (Main game can be played without collecting medals,<br />
        but extra stages still have their requirements)<br />
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/581838">Vanilla Werehog Tweaks</a> (Small movements tweaks to the werehog,<br />
        so the night stages are more fun to play)</p>
      <p>(I will add more info on how to set up HedgeModManager once I play this game for myself)</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SC">Sonic Colors</h2>
      <p>While Sonic Colors Ultimate is the definitive version of the game, it also introduces new bugs and an unglodly amount of bloom.<br />
        Luckily, we can fix the pc release with a single mod, <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/535070">Project Re-Rainbow</a>, via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager/releases">HedgeModManager</a>.</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic colors ultimate Base Edition (PC) + Project Re-Rainbow | 40€</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>After you have installed the mod manager, you'll see that there are multiple downloads on the gamebanana page.<br />
        They only differ in cutscene quality and file size:<br />
        - Lite is 3.5GB and uses the old cutscenes<br />
        - 1080p has scaled down the revamped cutscenes and is 14GB<br />
        - Full has the high quality, revamped cutscenes and is 21GB<br />
        Make sure you pick a version that you can sustainably keep on your pc, not one that barely fits onto your harddrive.<br />
        It shoul also be noted that the current version of the mod is not finished yet, and was just released for the SHC showcase.</p>
      <p>(I will add more info on how to set up HedgeModManager once I play this game for myself)</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SG">Sonic x Shadow Generations</h2>
      <p>Sonic Generations was rereleased as sonic x shadow generations, adding some slight QoL to sonics campaign,<br />
        and adding a shorter shadow campaign. While there are some minor differences between Gens 2011 and Gens 2024,<br />
        the 2024 release is the definitive version for new players</p>
      <p>The game also has a small DLC adding 3 extra, sonic moivie flavoured, shadow stages that you might wanna grab</p>
      <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic x Shadow Generations Base Edition + StH 3 Movie DLC (Any platform) | 50€ + 6€</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>Since were not installing any mods, well just go through the settings menu to fix any performance issues.<br />
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9vBGy0RImw">This video</a> goes over all the settings in case you need help.</p>
      <p>Have fun playing a game vnanilly for once ;3</p>

    <hr style="padding: 0em 6em"/>

    <h2 id="SF">Sonic Frontiers</h2>
      <p>Sonic Frontiers only has one release, and its a bit buggy. While its still a playable game in its vanilla state,<br >
        we'll use a buch of mods and codes inside the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager/releases">HedgeModManager</a> to fix all the little bugs, and add some small QoL</p>
    <h3>Definitive Version:</h3>
      <p>Sonic Frontiers Base Edition (PC) + HedgeModManager | 60€</p>
    <h3>Guide:</h3>
      <p>Sonic Frontiers as a BUNCH of codes already built into the mod mangager, so once you installed it,<br />
        these are the ones you want to enable:<br />
        >Animation<br />
        -Disable Running Fall (plays the fall animation instead of the run animation when falling in some cases)<br />
        >Cheats:<br />
        -Always start with max rings for bosses (does what it says on the tin. This one isnt strictly necessary)<br />
        -Always unlock arcade mode (arcade mode lets you play cyberspace levels from the main menu. normally youd have to unlock it first)<br />
        -Always unlock extreme difficulty (normally youd have to unlock the hardest difficulty first)<br />
        >Fixes:<br />
        -Fix grind leaning (re-adds the intended leaning animation)<br />
        -Fix Quick Cyloop Lock-on (prevents randomly changing target during quick cyloop)<br />
        -Fix resolution resetting on launch (stop resolution from resetting in some nieche cases)<br />
        -Fix photo mode camera collision (camera slides along objects instead of freezing)<br />
        -Fix player de-celeration (fixes deceleration bug that happens when decel. isnt at 100%)<br />
        >Gameplay:<br />
        -Tutorial Skip (option to skip tutorial on new file)<br />
        >Graphics:<br />
        -2x Extended Foliage draw distance (skip this if your pc struggles to run the game)<br />
        -2x Extended grass draw distance(skip this if your pc struggles to run the game)<br />
        -Disable shadow angle limit (shadows line up wit hthe sun much better)<br />
        >Physics:<br />
        -Enhanced homing attack rebound (more controll while flinning backwards after a homing attack)<br />
        -Tighter jump rotation (more directional controll midair)<br />
        >System:<br />
        -Disable Telemetry (telemetry: any data about your system that gets sent to sega)<br />
        >UI:<br />
        -Disable DLC Messages on new game (doesn't disable dlc. only removes the amlost 10 popups when starting a new file)<br />
        -Show another story stages in arcade mode (adds free dlc stages to arcade mode quick select) </p>
        <p>Since codes already fix most of the smaller stuff, we only need to add a few mods:<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/493726">Medium Foliage</a> (better performance and slightly less dense trees)<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/534423">Knuckles Climbing Tweaks</a> (so you dont fly off of the parkcour)<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/544154">Sensible Pinball</a> (sets points from 5.000.000 to 1.000.000)<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/476302">Pinball Revisited</a> (makes the pinball minigame playable postgame)<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/411700">No Cutscenes After Challenges</a> (speeds up the map filling out, and removes the zoom to the seed)<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/415617">Trackers Phyisics</a> (small physics changes. going down hills increases speed)</p>
        <p>After these million small changes, you should be able to enjoy frontiers alot more. Have fun playing  ;3</p>
