    <h3>Sonic Games Guide</h3>

    <h3>Minecraft Modpacks</h3>
    <p>I used to make a bunch of modpacks for my server back in the day. While most of them just slap together vaguely related mods,<br />
      there are a few old ones and some newer ones i liked enough to put them on here.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/world-of-life-rekindled">World of Life - Rekindled</a> (2025) is an updated version of my old World of Life pack.<br />
      Its supposed to be scummy and hard, so i don't mind it being a basic pack.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/project/kingdoms-and-castles-rekindled">Kingdoms and Castles - Rekindled</a> (2025) is a medieval, rpg inspired modpack with detailed quest progression and loads of bosses and unique loot.<br />
      It even has some cozy elements for medieval roleplay.<br />
      Technically it's not an updated version of an old modpack, but a melting pot of all my old, unfocused, medieval type modpacks</p>
    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/wmnfb56dagp63i2/Invasion_Pack_%255BPixelbraker%255D-1.1.0_TWITCH.zip/file">Invasion Pack</a> (2020) still isnt completed, but ill get back to it in time. It's a small modpack around the invasion mod,<br />
      tasking players to defend thier nexus from smarter mobs for as many waves as possible.</p>
    <p>If youre still interested in the old modpacks, i archived most of them on <a target="_blank" href="https://pixelbraker.jimdosite.com/minecraft/">this old website</a>. Its in german tho.</p>

    <h3>Minecraft Mods</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/pixelbreaker-expansion-2">Pixelbreaker Expansion 2</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelbreaker-expansion-2-pxbr_core-2">Mirror</a>) (2022-23) Was the last MCreator mod i worked on before i took a break from modded minecraft. <br />
      Its full of misc. features that enhance modded play.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/pixelbreaker-expansion">Pixelbreaker Expansion</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelbraker-expansion">Mirror</a>) (2019-21) was the first big mod i worked on. So naturally, it became really messy and i had to start from scratch.</p>
      <p>I also created 2 smaller mods that got integrated into the Expansion later on. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelblocks-coin-economy">Voxel's Coin Economy</a> (2021), which later turned into emerald shards, <br />
      and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/harder-cobblestone-pixelbraker">Harder Cobblestone</a> (2019), which was a feature in the old expansion, before deepslate was a thing. <br /></p>

    <h3>Trouble in Terrorist Town Mods</h3>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3355632160">ttt_warehouse</a> (2024) is my first attempt at a completely original map. Its playable, but not finished yet.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990882265">ttt_City_Center_23</a> (2023) is my first attempt at modifying a hammer map. The changes are mostly functional, and not pretty.</p>
      <p>I rebalanced a few weapons for my private ttt server, namely nerfing the <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990850041">G36c</a>, buffing the <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3336119131">Smart Pistol</a> and providing a working version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990845088">tec9</a>. <br /></p>

    <h3>Physical Games</h3>
      <p>Im also working on a game where the players take the roles of differently alligned advisors to a King. Every round, the players can expend influence <br />
      to get the most benefits from a vote. I'll link it once its in a slightly more polished state.</p>
